            <article class="col-sm-12 col-md-12">

                <p> Video game addiction (VGA) is a behavioral addiction characterized by excessive or compulsive use of
                    computer games or video games that interferes with a person's everyday life. Video game addiction
                    may present itself as compulsive gaming, social isolation, mood swings, diminished imagination, and
                    hyper-focus on in-game achievements, to the exclusion of other events in life.</p>

                <p>In May 2013, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) proposed criteria for video game addiction in
                    the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, concluding that there
                    was insufficient evidence to include it as an official mental disorder. However, proposed criteria
                    for "Internet Gaming Disorder" were included in a section called "Conditions for Further Study".</p>

                <p> While Internet gaming disorder is proposed as a disorder, it is still discussed how much this
                    disorder is caused by the gaming activity itself, or whether it is to some extent an effect of other
                    disorders. Contradictions in research examining video game addictiveness may reflect more general
                    inconsistencies in video game research. For example, while some research has linked violent video
                    games with increased aggressive behavior other research has failed to find evidence for such
                    links. </p>

                <h2>Possible Causes</h2>

                <p>Some theorists focus on presumed built-in reward systems of the games to explain their potentially
                    addictive nature. Many video games, particularly massively multiplayer online role-playing games and
                    social network and mobile games, rely on a "compulsion loop" or "core loop", a cycle of activities
                    that involve rewarding the player and driving them to continue through another cycle, retaining them
                    in the game. The anticipation of such rewards can create a neurological reaction that releases
                    dopamine into the body, so that once the reward is obtained, the person will remember it as a
                    pleasurable feeling. This has been found similar to the same neurological reaction believed to be
                    associated with gambling addiction. In reference to gamers such as one suicide in China, the head of
                    one software association was quoted, "In the hypothetical world created by such games, they become
                    confident and gain satisfaction, which they cannot get in the real world."</p>

                <p>Griffiths has also proposed that another reason why online video games are potentially addictive is
                    because they "can be played all day every day". The fact that there is no end to the game can feel
                    rewarding for some, and hence players are further engaged in the game.</p>

                <p>A high prenatal testosterone load may be a risk factor for the development of video game addiction in
                    adulthood.</p>

                <p>Ferguson, Coulson and Barnett in a meta-analytic review of the research, concluded that the evidence
                    suggests that video game addiction arises out of other mental health problems, rather than causing
                    them. Thus it is unclear whether video game addiction should be considered a unique diagnosis.</p>

                <p>Researchers at the University of Rochester and Immersyve, Inc. (a Celebration, Florida, computer
                    gaming think-tank) investigated what motivates gamers to continue playing video games. According to
                    lead investigator Richard Ryan, they believe that players play for more reasons than fun alone.
                    Ryan, a motivational psychologist at Rochester, says that many video games satisfy basic
                    psychological needs, and players often continue to play because of rewards, freedom, and a
                    connection to other players.</p>

                <p>Michael Brody, M.D., head of the TV and Media Committee of the American Academy of Child and
                    Adolescent Psychiatry, stated in a 2007 press release that "... there is not enough research on
                    whether or not video games are addictive". However, Brody also cautioned that for some children and
                    adolescents, "... it displaces physical activity and time spent on studies, with friends, and even
                    with family".</p>

                <p>Karen Pierce, a psychiatrist at Chicago's Children's Memorial Hospital, sees no need for a specific
                    gaming addiction diagnosis. Two or more children see her each week because of excessive computer and
                    video game play, and she treats their problems as she would any addiction. She said one of her
                    excessive-gaming patients "...hasn't been to bed, hasn't showered...He is really a mess".</p>

                <h2>Treatment</h2>

                <p>Because few clinical trials and no meta-analyses have been completed, research is still in the
                    preliminary stages for excessive gaming treatment. The most effective treatments seem to be, as with
                    other addictions and dependencies, a combination of psychopharmacology, psychotherapy and
                    twelve-step programs.</p>

                <p>Some countries, such as South Korea, China, the Netherlands, Canada, and the United States, have
                    responded to the perceived threat of video game addiction by opening treatment centers.</p>

                <h3>Support groups</h3>

                <p>Online Gamers Anonymous, an American non-profit organization formed in 2002, is a twelve-step,
                    self-help, support and recovery organization for gamers and their loved ones who are suffering from
                    the adverse effects of excessive computer gaming. The organization provides a variety of message
                    boards and other tools for healing and support.</p>

                <p>Computer Gaming Addicts Anonymous (CGAA), formed in 2014, is a recovery fellowship, based on the
                    model of Alcoholics Anonymous, with specifically adapted forms of the twelve steps and twelve
                    traditions. CGAA groups hold meetings in several cities around the world and hold voice meetings
                    online.</p>

                <h3> Selected treatment options, by country</h3>
                <h4>China</h4>
                <p>The Chinese government operates several clinics to treat those suffering from overuse of online
                    games, chatting and web surfing. Treatment for the patients, most of whom have been forced to attend
                    by parents or government officials, include various forms of pain including shock therapy. In August
                    2009, Deng Sanshan was reportedly beaten to death in a correctional facility for video game and Web
                    addiction.</p>

                <h4>Netherlands</h4>
                <p> In June 2006, the Smith and Jones clinic in Amsterdam – which has now gone bankrupt – became the
                    first treatment facility in Europe to offer a residential treatment program for compulsive gamers.
                    Keith Bakker, founder and former head of the clinic, has stated that 90% of the young people who
                    seek treatment for compulsive computer gaming are not addicted.</p>

                <h4>United States</h4>
                <p>McLean Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts has set up Computer Addiction Services. Elsewhere, gamers
                    may seek services at generalized addiction support centers.</p>

                <p>In July 2009, ReSTART, a residential treatment center for "pathological computer use", opened in Fall
                    City, near Seattle, Washington.</p>

                <h4>Canada</h4>
                <p> At a Computer Addiction Services center in Richmond, British Columbia, excessive gaming accounts for
                    80% of one youth counselor's caseload.</p>

                <h4>Australia</h4>
                <p>Network for Internet Investigation and Research Australia provides a list of therapists who help
                    video game and internet addicts.</p>

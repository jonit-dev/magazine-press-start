                <p>Kids who are good at video games tend to be more intelligent than those who just play outside, according to a new study.</p>

                <p>Researchers have discovered a link between young people’s ability to perform well at two games like League of Legends and Call of Duty and high levels of intelligence.
                </p>

                <p>Studies conducted at the Digital Creativity Labs (DC Labs) at York University found that some action strategy video games can act similar to IQ tests.</p>

                <p>The researchers stressed that the studies have no bearing on questions such as whether playing computer games makes young people smarter or otherwise.</p>

                <p>They said they simply establish a correlation between skill at certain online games of strategy and intelligence.</p>

                <p>The researchers focused on ‘Multiplayer Online Battle Arenas’ (MOBAs) — action strategy games that usually involve two opposing teams of up to five individuals — as well as multiplayer ‘First Person Shooter’ games.</p>

                <img src="gfx/pictures/gamer2.jpg" alt="Girl Picture" class="article-img">

                <p>These are two of the most popular types of computer game and are regularly played by hundreds of millions worldwide.</p>

                <p>Researchers from York’s Departments of Psychology and Computer Science carried out two studies.The first examined a group of subjects who were highly experienced in League of Legends — one of the most popular strategic video games in the world with millions of players.</p>

                <p>In the study, the researchers observed a correlation between performance in the strategic game League of Legends and performance in standard paper-and-pencil intelligence tests.</p>

                <p>The second study analysed data from four games: two MOBAs — League of Legends and Defense of the Ancients 2 (Dota 2) — and two ‘First Person Shooters’ — Destiny and Battlefield 3.</p>

                <p></p>First Person Shooters (FPS) are games involving shooting enemies and other targets, with the player viewing the action as though through the eyes of the character they are controlling.

                <p></p>In the second study, the researchers found that for large groups consisting of thousands of players, performance in MOBAs and IQ behave in similar ways as players get older.

               <p> But the effect was not found for First Person Shooters, where performance declined after the teens. The researchers say the correlation between ability at action strategy video games such as League of Legends and Defense of the Ancients 2 and a high IQ is similar to the correlation seen in other more traditional strategy games such as chess.</p>

                <p>Study corresponding author Professor Alex Wade said: “Games such as League of Legends and DOTA 2 are complex, socially-interactive and intellectually demanding.</p>

                <p>“Our research would suggest that your performance in these games can be a measure of intelligence.</p>

                <p>“Research in the past has pointed to the fact that people who are good at strategy games such as chess tend to score highly at IQ tests.</p>

                <p>“Our research has extended this to games that millions of people across the planet play every day.” The researchers say the discovery of the correlation between skill and intelligence opens up a huge new data source.</p>

                <p>For example, as ‘proxy’ tests of IQ, games could be useful at a global population level in fields such as ‘cognitive epidemiology’ — research that examines the associations between intelligence and health across time — and as a way of monitoring cognitive health across populations.</p>

                <p>Study lead author Athanasios Kokkinakis, a PhD student at York, said: “Unlike First Person Shooter games where speed and target accuracy are a priority, Multiplayer Online Battle Arenas rely more on memory and the ability to make strategic decisions taking into account multiple factors.</p>

                <p>Co-author Professor Peter Cowling said: “This cutting-edge research has the potential for substantial impact on the future of the games and creative industries – and on games as a tool for research in health and psychology.</p>

                <p>“The IGGI program has 48 excellent PhD students working with industry and across disciplines — there is plenty more to come.”
